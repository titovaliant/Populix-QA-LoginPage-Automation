C. Explain briefly between test suite, test case, and test step!

1. Test Suite:
Test suites are a collection of test cases, Test suites are created 
based on the scope of the test plan.
They could contain any kind of tests, functional or Non-Functional.
In other words test suites as the “folder” your test cases are stored in.

2. Test Case: 
A set of test case preconditions, inputs (including actions, step, where applicable),
expected results, postconditions, developed to drive the execution of a test item
to meet test objectives.

3. Test Step:
Test Steps describe the execution steps and expected results that are documented 
against each one of those steps of testing. Each step is marked pass, fail or block/skip 
based on the comparison result between the expected and actual outcome.

D. What's the difference between regression test and non-regression test?

1. Regression test:
Testing unchanged areas of existing functionality to verify
they are not affected by the code modifications.
The aim of regression testing is to ensure that modification in the code 
does not introduced any errors in the existing functionality of application,
not to test if the bug itself has been fixed.

2. Non-Regression test:
Non-regression testing is to verify whether a new or modified 
functionality work correctly or not with the assumption that the previous functionality wasn't affected
